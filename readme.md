# Stand in front of scenery slideshow
Stand in front of scenery! With music!

Imagine yourself standing in front of the world's grandest scenery. In front of the grand canyon. In lush forests. Accompanied with music. 

Yup, that's this project in a nutshell.

This is a very silly project.

This project retrieves its images from Imgur using Imgur API ( [r/earthporn on Imgur](http://imgur.com/r/earthporn) by default); it also uses [imagesloaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded) for loading of images and [Pace.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/pace) for preloading.

# Features
1. Stand in front of scenery (or... any sort of background image you can conjure). Be where you can never be in your lifetime. Pose like never before.
2. Listen to awesome music while posing like a boss.
3. Change the scenery when you get tired of it.
4. Indulge in earth porn! Get detailed information of what you are posing in front of.

# Editor
I have an editor which I will setup a repo for tomorrow.
