# Scenery Traveller
Stand in front of scenery! With music!

Demo:
[With disco effects (The way it's meant to be enjoyed!)](https://crazoter.github.io/Scenery-Traveller/scenery_slideshow-disco.html)

[*Without* disco effects (The serious demo)](https://crazoter.github.io/Scenery-Traveller/scenery_slideshow.html)

By default, the person featured is Evan (imaginary person) and the images are from [r/earthporn on Imgur](http://imgur.com/r/earthporn). You can create your own version here: https://github.com/crazoter/Scenery-Traveller-Editor.

Imagine yourself standing in front of the world's grandest scenery. In front of the grand canyon. In lush forests. Accompanied with music. 

You are a traveller from the comfort of your home.

Yup, that's this project in a nutshell.

This is a very silly project.

This project retrieves its images from Imgur using Imgur API ( [r/earthporn on Imgur](http://imgur.com/r/earthporn) by default); it also uses [imagesloaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded) for loading of images and [Pace.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/pace) for preloading.

# Features
1. **Immersive**: Stand in front of scenery (or... any sort of background image you can conjure). Be where you can never be in your lifetime. Pose like never before.
2. **Melodic**: Listen to awesome music while posing like a boss.
3. **Full Control**: Change the scenery when you get tired of it.
4. **Informative**: Indulge in earth porn! Get detailed information of what you are posing in front of.
5. **Responsive**: Adventure anywhere, anytime, on any device.

# Known Issues
1. **I am floating on air / I am standing on water**: I know. I am, however, unwilling to expend incredulous amounts of efforts to create a "stand-on-solid-ground" algorithm for such a satirical project.
  * Okay, it probably isn't so hard by simply checking the color of the pixels on where the person is supposed to be standing, or by simply allowing the user to drag and drop the person.
